                The term 'plastic' covers a broad range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials made through processes like polymerization or condensation reactions. These materials can be shaped or molded into various objects, films, coatings, adhesives, and more. The word 'plastic' comes from the Greek word 'plastikos', which means 'capable of being molded or shaped', and has been used to describe these materials since 1884.

                Today, 'plastic' can refer to a wide array of materials, including synthetic polymers like polyethylene, PVC, or nylon. It can also encompass synthetic resins formed by polymerizing smaller molecules like phenols, aldehydes, or amines, which are often used in molding and casting processes.

                A polymer is a type of chemical compound made up of large molecules composed of repeating structural units. These units are typically connected by covalent bonds. Polymers are present in a diverse range of products, including plastics, rubbers, adhesives, and textiles.

                The term "polymer" originates from the Greek words "polus," meaning "many/much," and "meros," meaning "part." The simplest polymers consist of linear chains of monomers, which are individual molecules bonded together in a sequence to form polymer chains. However, more intricate polymers can be created from monomers with multiple functional groups, resulting in branched or cross-linked polymers.

                Polymers can be classified as natural or synthetic. Natural polymers include substances like proteins, nucleic acids, and cellulose. On the other hand, synthetic polymers are derived from petroleum-based monomers such as ethylene and propylene.

                The properties of polymers vary widely based on their molecular structure. For instance, the strength and elasticity of fibers like Kevlar and nylon stem from their long chain-like structure, while the flexibility of rubber arises from its cross-linked structure.

                A polymer is a chemical compound consisting of large molecules, made up of repeating structural units; these units are typically connected by covalent bonds. Polymers are found in a wide variety of products, including plastics, rubbers, adhesives, and textiles.

                The term “polymer” comes from the Greek word πολύς (‘polus, meaning ‘many/much’) and μέρος (‘meros’, meaning ‘part’). The simplest polymers are linear chains of monomers; monomers are the individual molecules that bond together in sequence to form polymer chains. However, more complex polymers can be formed from monomers with more than one functional group, forming branched polymers or cross-linked polymers.

                Polymers can be natural or synthetic. Natural polymers include proteins, nucleic acids, and cellulose. Synthetic polymers are made from petroleum-based monomers such as ethylene and propylene.

                Polymers have a wide range of properties that depend on their molecular structure. For example, the strength and elasticity of fibres like Kevlar and nylon come from their long chain-like structure, while the flexibility of rubber comes from its cross-linked structure.
